- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- WiFi TCP Connection

## Getting Started
Development environment used for this application:
- Visual Studio Code (version 1.44.2)
- PlatformIO IDE for VSCode

Platform and board:
- ESP32 Pico

Libraries used (see platformio.ini):
- JC_Button
- FastLED
- BLE ESP32 Arduino
- WiFi

Configuration via `platformio.ini`:
- `default_envs = pico32_ble` or
- `default_envs = pico32_wifi`
